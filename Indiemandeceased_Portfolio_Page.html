                     Hi & Welcome! I use Indiemandeceased as a Pseudonym (obviously); my first name is Chris. If you would like to know where Indiemandeceased came from, contact me and I will tell you the story.</p>
                
                 <p class="p">
                     In the meantime, let me tell you a bit about myself. I am a Humanities graduate with a passion for code, writing and playing guitar. I live and work in Lincolnshire (UK) and am working towards developing my career to include full-stack development.</p>   
                 <p class="p"> I have slowly been developing my skills and experience over the last year and a half. I started with HTML and have moved onto using VBA, Python and VB.NEt & C++. I'm a huge fan of Linux Operating Systems and I dual-boot my PC at home with Windows 10 & Ubuntu Mate; I also use Raspberry Pi at home for most of my coding practice.</p>  
                 <div>
                     <p class='p'> On this page you will find links to soem of my recent projects and, as my skills develop, these links will include more & more projects as I work my way through freeCodeCamp's Full Stack Developer course.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div>
                     <p class='p'> Comments & Suggestions are always welcome, as are queries about hiring me: As I am new to this, I am willing to work on projects for free in my spare time. This will enable me to build a portfolio & of course, you get some free IT and support; so, if you are a charitable organisation or a new business with a tech need, please contact me using the form below and I will do my best to help you. Bear in mind there is no guarantee and any work undertaken will be at my sole discretion and with an honest intention to get it done.</p>
